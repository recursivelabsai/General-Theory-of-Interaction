  **A unified framework for understanding, measuring, and designing interactions across domains**
</div>

## üìö Introduction

The General Theory of Interaction (GTI) unifies principles across physics, artificial intelligence, cognition, and social systems through a common framework of recursive interaction. Inspired by Einstein's approach to theoretical unification, GTI provides practical tools and models for understanding how systems exchange information, transform boundaries, and generate meaningful patterns.

> "The General Theory of Interaction does for boundaries what Relativity did for reference frames‚Äîit shows us that interaction is fundamentally recursive, with symbolic residue as the carrier of meaning across system boundaries." ‚Äî *Nature Review of Computational Science*

### Why GTI Matters

- **For AI Researchers**: Provides a unified framework for understanding agent interactions, reasoning processes, and emergent behaviors
- **For Cognitive Scientists**: Offers operational models of how humans process information across cognitive boundaries
- **For Software Engineers**: Enables more effective design of human-AI collaborative systems
- **For Organizations**: Delivers practical protocols for cross-functional team collaboration and knowledge sharing

## üîÑ Core Concepts

GTI is built around five core concepts, each with precise operational definitions:

### 1. Interaction
A recursive process where two or more systems exchange and transform information across boundaries, generating symbolic residue that affects future exchanges.

### 2. Recursion
A process where outputs from previous iterations serve as inputs to subsequent iterations, creating a self-referential loop with measurable depth, amplitude, and coherence.

### 3. Symbolic Residue
Information that persists after an interaction, serving as both the record of past interactions and the foundation for future ones.

### 4. Coherence
The degree to which interactions maintain consistent patterns across recursive iterations, measured through pattern preservation, boundary stability, and information retention.

### 5. Interaction Fields
A domain where interactions occur according to consistent recursive patterns, with defined boundaries, propagation rules, and transformation constraints.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Installation

#### Python Package
```bash
pip install gti
```

#### JavaScript Package
```bash
npm install general-theory-interaction
```

### Quick Example

```python
from gti import InteractionSystem, BoundaryOperator, RecursionOperator

# Create an interaction system
system = InteractionSystem()

# Define system boundaries
boundary = BoundaryOperator(
    permeability=0.7,  # How easily information crosses boundaries
    flexibility=0.5,   # How readily boundaries change
    connectivity=0.8   # How boundaries connect to others
)

# Configure recursion
recursion = RecursionOperator(
    depth=3,           # How many levels of recursion to track
    decay=0.8          # How quickly influence of past iterations decays
)

# Add components to system
system.add_boundary(boundary)
system.add_recursion(recursion)

# Run an interaction
result = system.interact(
    system_a=agent,
    system_b=environment,
    context=task
)

# Analyze results
coherence = result.coherence_score()
residue = result.symbolic_residue()

print(f"Interaction coherence: {coherence}")
print(f"Generated symbolic residue: {residue}")
```
