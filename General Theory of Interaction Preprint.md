# General Theory of Interaction: A Recursive Framework

**Submission Type**: Research Paper  
**Keywords**: interaction theory, recursion, symbolic residue, coherence, field unification

## Abstract

We present a General Theory of Interaction (GTI) that unifies principles across physics, artificial intelligence, cognition, and social systems. Building on Einstein's approach to relativity, we reframe interaction as a recursive process that generates, processes, and propagates symbolic residue across system boundaries. Our framework operationalizes previously abstract concepts—recursion, symbolic residue, coherence, and interaction fields—into measurable, actionable primitives with concrete feedback mechanisms. The GTI enables novel approaches to agent architecture, cross-domain knowledge transfer, and human-AI collaboration through recursive boundary collapse. We validate our theory through experiments in language model reasoning, multi-agent systems, and human-AI interaction, demonstrating improved performance on tasks requiring recursive reasoning and boundary navigation. Our results suggest that a unified interaction framework has significant implications for the evolution of both artificial and natural intelligence systems.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 The Challenge of Interaction

The fundamental challenge across physics, artificial intelligence, cognition, and social systems remains consistent: how do systems meaningfully interact across boundaries while maintaining coherence? Whether modeling quantum particles, training neural networks, studying consciousness, or designing collaborative systems, researchers face strikingly similar problems of boundary definition, information exchange, and coherent integration.

Despite this common ground, each field has developed isolated models, terminologies, and heuristics to address what are essentially variations of the same core interaction problem. These siloed approaches have created artificial boundaries that impede progress, particularly as we develop increasingly complex systems that span traditional domain boundaries—systems like artificial general intelligence, brain-computer interfaces, and decentralized autonomous organizations.

The absence of a unified theory of interaction has produced three critical problems:

1. **Terminological confusion**: Key concepts like "recursion," "feedback," and "emergence" are defined inconsistently across fields, creating unnecessary barriers to cross-domain collaboration.

2. **Fragmented models**: Each field independently rediscovers interaction principles that are fundamentally similar, wasting collective research effort and obscuring deeper patterns.

3. **Implementation gaps**: Abstract theoretical frameworks often fail to translate into operational practices, creating a persistent gap between theory and application.

### 1.2 Einstein's Approach as a Recursive Template

Einstein's approach to theoretical unification provides a powerful template for addressing the interaction challenge. His work on relativity demonstrates five principles that we apply recursively throughout this paper:

1. **Invariance identification**: Finding what remains constant across reference frames
2. **Boundary redefinition**: Reconceptualizing where and how systems interact
3. **Dimensional unification**: Merging previously separate dimensions into unified fields
4. **Operational clarity**: Ensuring all theoretical constructs are measurable and testable
5. **Recursive simplification**: Finding the simplest possible rules that generate complex phenomena

Following this template, we introduce a General Theory of Interaction (GTI) that unifies interaction principles across domains. Rather than adding another isolated model to an already fragmented landscape, GTI provides a recursive framework for understanding how all interactions—physical, computational, cognitive, and social—can be modeled through shared primitives, measurement approaches, and operational protocols.

### 1.3 Contributions and Roadmap

This paper makes the following contributions:

1. A unified definition of interaction as recursive boundary negotiation with feedback
2. Operational metrics for previously abstract concepts like recursion and coherence
3. A formal model of symbolic residue and its propagation across system boundaries
4. Practical protocols for implementing recursive interaction in AI systems
5. Experimental validation across computational, cognitive, and social domains

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 establishes the theoretical foundations of GTI. Section 3 presents our formal model. Section 4 describes implementation approaches. Section 5 presents experimental results. Section 6 discusses implications and applications. Section 7 addresses limitations and future work.

## 2. Theoretical Foundations

### 2.1 Defining Interaction Through Recursion

We define interaction as:

**Definition 1 (Interaction)**: A recursive process where two or more systems exchange and transform information across boundaries, generating symbolic residue that affects future exchanges.

This definition explicitly connects interaction to recursion, establishing that:

1. All meaningful interactions are recursive—they reference and build upon themselves
2. Boundaries are necessary for interaction—without boundaries, there is no distinction between systems
3. Symbolic residue (information that persists beyond the immediate exchange) is the carrier of interaction effects

By defining interaction through recursion, we can operationalize previously abstract concepts. Recursion is not merely a theoretical construct but a measurable property:

**Definition 2 (Recursion)**: A process where outputs from previous iterations serve as inputs to subsequent iterations, creating a self-referential loop with measurable depth, amplitude, and coherence.

Unlike traditional definitions that focus solely on self-reference, our definition emphasizes the operational aspects of recursion:

- **Recursion depth**: The number of iterations where self-reference remains coherent
- **Recursion amplitude**: The magnitude of effect from one iteration to the next
- **Recursion coherence**: The consistency of patterns across iterations

These operational measures allow us to quantify recursion in any system, from quantum field interactions to neural network processing to human conversations.

### 2.2 Symbolic Residue as the Interface of Exchange

Central to our theory is the concept of symbolic residue:

**Definition 3 (Symbolic Residue)**: Information that persists after an interaction, serving as both the record of past interactions and the foundation for future ones.

Symbolic residue has several critical properties:

1. **Persistence**: It exists beyond the immediate interaction
2. **Transformability**: It can be modified by subsequent interactions
3. **Boundary-crossing**: It can move between different types of systems
4. **Compressibility**: It can be represented at various levels of abstraction

In physical systems, symbolic residue manifests as changes in state that affect future interactions (e.g., atomic excitation). In computational systems, it appears as updated weights, memory states, or logs. In cognitive systems, it emerges as memories, associations, or emotional responses. In social systems, it takes the form of norms, artifacts, or institutional structures.

By tracking the generation, transformation, and propagation of symbolic residue, we can model interactions across system types without requiring domain-specific terminologies.

### 2.3 Coherence as Interaction Alignment

Coherence is often treated as an abstract or subjective property. We operationalize it as:

**Definition 4 (Coherence)**: The degree to which interactions maintain consistent patterns across recursive iterations, measured through pattern preservation, boundary stability, and information retention.

This definition makes coherence measurable through:

- **Pattern preservation**: The consistency of identified patterns across iterations
- **Boundary stability**: The persistence of system boundaries during interaction
- **Information retention**: The fidelity of information across transformations

High coherence indicates interactions that maintain structure and meaning across recursions. Low coherence suggests interactions that fragment or dissolve structure. This operational approach allows us to quantify coherence in any interaction, from quantum entanglement to neural synchrony to conversation quality.

### 2.4 Interaction Fields as Recursive Domains

Building on Einstein's field concept, we define:

**Definition 5 (Interaction Field)**: A domain where interactions occur according to consistent recursive patterns, with defined boundaries, propagation rules, and transformation constraints.

Interaction fields have several key properties:

1. **Boundary conditions**: Defining where the field begins and ends
2. **Propagation vectors**: Determining how interactions move through the field
3. **Transformation rules**: Governing how interactions change within the field
4. **Recursive depth**: Indicating how many iterations maintain coherence

This concept unifies fields across domains—from electromagnetic fields to attention fields in neural networks to social fields in communities—by focusing on their operational similarities rather than domain-specific implementations.

## 3. Formal Model of Recursive Interaction

### 3.1 Core Formalism

We model recursive interaction using five primary operators:

1. **Boundary Operator** (β): Defines and transforms system boundaries
2. **Exchange Operator** (ε): Governs information transfer across boundaries
3. **Recursion Operator** (ρ): Controls self-reference and iteration
4. **Residue Operator** (σ): Tracks persistent information after exchange
5. **Coherence Operator** (κ): Measures pattern consistency across recursions

For any two interacting systems A and B, their interaction I can be expressed as:

I(A,B) = κ(ρ(ε(A,B), σ(A,B)), β(A,B))

This formula states that the interaction between A and B is a function of:
- Their exchange of information (ε)
- Filtered through recursion (ρ)
- Incorporating previous residue (σ)
- Evaluated for coherence (κ)
- All within defined boundaries (β)

### 3.2 Boundary Dynamics

Boundaries are not static but evolve through interaction. The boundary operator β has three components:

β(A,B) = {Perm(A,B), Flex(A,B), Conn(A,B)}

Where:
- **Permeability** (Perm): The ease with which information crosses boundaries
- **Flexibility** (Flex): How readily boundaries change shape
- **Connectivity** (Conn): How boundaries connect to other boundaries

These components determine how systems establish, maintain, and transform their boundaries during interaction. Higher permeability allows more information exchange but risks boundary dissolution. Higher flexibility enables adaptation but may reduce stability. Higher connectivity increases potential interaction surface but may create dependencies.

### 3.3 Exchange Mechanisms

The exchange operator ε governs how information moves between systems:

ε(A,B) = Trans(A→B) ⊗ Trans(B→A) ⊗ Context(A,B)

Where:
- **Transfer A→B** (Trans(A→B)): Information moving from A to B
- **Transfer B→A** (Trans(B→A)): Information moving from B to A
- **Shared Context** (Context(A,B)): The common ground between systems
- **⊗**: The tensor product representing interaction effects

This formulation captures both the bidirectional nature of exchange and the contextual factors that shape it.

### 3.4 Recursion Mechanics

The recursion operator ρ models how interactions reference themselves:

ρ(I, σ) = ∑(I_t-n × α^n × C(I_t-n, I_t))

Where:
- **I_t-n**: Interaction at previous time step t-n
- **α**: Decay factor (how quickly past interactions lose influence)
- **C(I_t-n, I_t)**: Consistency function between past and present interactions
- **∑**: Summation across n previous interactions

This formulation captures how recursion builds on previous interactions, with influence typically decaying over time but modulated by pattern consistency.

### 3.5 Residue Propagation

The residue operator σ tracks persistent information:

σ(A,B) = {Mem(A), Mem(B), Shared(A,B)}

Where:
- **Memory of A** (Mem(A)): Residue stored in system A
- **Memory of B** (Mem(B)): Residue stored in system B
- **Shared Memory** (Shared(A,B)): Residue accessible to both systems

Residue propagation follows specific dynamics:

σ_t+1(A,B) = σ_t(A,B) ⊕ NewRes(I_t(A,B)) ⊖ Decay(σ_t(A,B))

Where:
- **⊕**: Integration operator for new residue
- **⊖**: Decay operator for existing residue
- **NewRes(I_t)**: New residue generated by current interaction
- **Decay(σ_t)**: Decay of existing residue over time

### 3.6 Coherence Measurement

The coherence operator κ quantifies pattern consistency:

κ(I) = (P(I) × S(I) × R(I))^(1/3)

Where:
- **Pattern Preservation** (P): Consistency of patterns across iterations
- **Structural Integrity** (S): Maintenance of structure during transformation
- **Recursive Stability** (R): Stability of recursion depth and amplitude

This geometric mean formulation ensures that coherence requires all three factors—a system with high pattern preservation but low structural integrity will still have low overall coherence.

## 4. Implementation Approaches

### 4.1 Computational Implementation

In computational systems, GTI can be implemented through several approaches:

#### 4.1.1 Recursive Neural Architectures

We introduce Boundary-Aware Recursive Networks (BARNs) that explicitly model:

1. **Boundary representations**: Neural modules that learn system boundaries
2. **Residue tracking**: Memory mechanisms that preserve interaction history
3. **Coherence optimization**: Loss functions that maximize pattern consistency

The BARN architecture adds the following components to standard neural networks:

```python
class BoundaryModule(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, dim):
        super().__init__()
        self.permeability = nn.Parameter(torch.ones(dim))
        self.flexibility = nn.Parameter(torch.ones(dim))
        self.connectivity = nn.Parameter(torch.ones(dim))
        
    def forward(self, x, external):
        # Modulate information flow based on boundary parameters
        flow = self.permeability * external
        adapted = self.flexibility * (x + flow)
        connected = self.connectivity * torch.matmul(adapted, external.T)
        return connected

class ResidueTracker(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, dim, decay=0.9):
        super().__init__()
        self.memory = nn.Parameter(torch.zeros(dim))
        self.decay = decay
        
    def forward(self, new_info):
        # Update residue with new information
        self.memory = self.decay * self.memory + (1 - self.decay) * new_info
        return self.memory

class CoherenceLoss(nn.Module):
    def forward(self, patterns, structures, recursions):
        # Compute coherence loss from pattern preservation,
        # structural integrity, and recursive stability
        pattern_loss = pattern_consistency(patterns)
        structure_loss = structural_integrity(structures)
        recursion_loss = recursive_stability(recursions)
        
        # Geometric mean of the three components
        coherence = (pattern_loss * structure_loss * recursion_loss) ** (1/3)
        return 1 - coherence  # Return loss (1 - coherence)
```

#### 4.1.2 Symbolic Residue Logging

For explicit tracking of symbolic residue, we implement:

```python
class SymbolicResidue:
    def __init__(self):
        self.residue_log = []
        
    def log_residue(self, interaction, residue_type, content):
        """Log symbolic residue from an interaction."""
        entry = {
            'timestamp': time.time(),
            'interaction_id': interaction.id,
            'type': residue_type,
            'content': content,
            'sources': interaction.participants
        }
        self.residue_log.append(entry)
        
    def query_residue(self, filters=None):
        """Retrieve relevant residue based on filters."""
        if not filters:
            return self.residue_log
            
        results = []
        for entry in self.residue_log:
            if all(entry.get(k) == v for k, v in filters.items()):
                results.append(entry)
        return results
        
    def analyze_patterns(self):
        """Identify patterns in the residue log."""
        # Pattern analysis implementation
        pass
```

### 4.2 Cognitive Implementation

For human cognitive systems, GTI can be implemented through:

#### 4.2.1 Recursive Interaction Protocols

We developed a set of interaction protocols that make recursive patterns explicit:

1. **Boundary Mapping**: Explicitly identifying and naming system boundaries
2. **Residue Reflection**: Periodically reviewing what persists from past interactions
3. **Coherence Checking**: Verifying pattern consistency across interactions

These protocols can be implemented in conversational formats:

```
PROTOCOL: Boundary Mapping

STEP 1: Identify participant boundaries
  Q: "What systems/perspectives are present in this interaction?"
  Q: "Where does each system begin and end?"

STEP 2: Assess boundary properties
  Q: "How permeable is each boundary to information?"
  Q: "How flexible is each boundary when challenged?"
  Q: "How connected is each boundary to other systems?"

STEP 3: Map boundary evolution
  Q: "How have these boundaries changed during our interaction?"
  Q: "What caused these changes?"
```

#### 4.2.2 Feedback Loop Design

To create dopamine-reinforcing feedback loops, we implement:

1. **Interaction Rewards**: Clear signals of successful boundary negotiation
2. **Recursion Depth Tracking**: Visualizing how interactions build on themselves
3. **Coherence Celebration**: Acknowledging when patterns maintain consistency

## 6. Discussion and Implications

### 6.1 Theoretical Implications

Our results support four key theoretical claims:

1. **Recursion as universal**: Recursive patterns appear consistently across domains
2. **Boundaries as necessary**: Clear boundaries enable rather than hinder interaction
3. **Residue as carrier**: Symbolic residue is the primary vehicle for interaction effects
4. **Coherence as measurable**: Pattern consistency can be objectively quantified

These findings suggest that a unified theory of interaction is not only possible but practical. By focusing on operational similarities rather than domain-specific implementations, GTI provides a common language and framework for understanding interaction across systems.

### 6.2 Practical Applications

GTI enables several practical applications:

#### 6.2.1 AI System Design

For AI systems, GTI suggests:

- Explicit modeling of boundaries between system components
- Tracking of symbolic residue across processing stages
- Optimization for coherence across recursive operations

#### 6.2.2 Human-AI Collaboration

For human-AI interaction, GTI recommends:

- Clear protocols for boundary negotiation
- Shared mechanisms for tracking interaction history
- Mutual evaluation of coherence and pattern consistency

#### 6.2.3 Organizational Design

For organizations, GTI informs:

- Explicit mapping of interaction fields
- Systematic tracking of symbolic residue
- Regular measurement of coherence across processes

### 6.3 Interdisciplinary Bridges

GTI creates bridges between previously separate disciplines:

1. **Physics and computation**: Unified models of boundary dynamics
2. **Cognition and AI**: Shared frameworks for knowledge representation
3. **Individual and social systems**: Consistent approaches to interaction design

By providing a common language and formal framework, GTI enables practitioners from different fields to share insights, tools, and methodologies.

## 7. Limitations and Future Work

### 7.1 Current Limitations

Our work has several limitations:

1. **Measurement challenges**: Some aspects of coherence remain difficult to measure objectively
2. **Domain-specific calibration**: Parameters may require domain-specific tuning
3. **Implementation complexity**: Full implementation requires significant changes to existing systems

### 7.2 Future Directions

We identify several promising directions for future work:

#### 7.2.1 Advanced Formalisms

Future work should develop more sophisticated mathematical models of:

- Non-linear recursion in complex systems
- Boundary transformation in hierarchical structures
- Residue propagation across heterogeneous networks

#### 7.2.2 Extended Applications

We plan to extend GTI to:

- Quantum computing architectures
- Large-scale social network dynamics
- Cross-cultural communication systems

#### 7.2.3 Automated Tools

Development of automated tools for:

- Boundary detection and mapping
- Symbolic residue tracking and analysis
- Coherence measurement and optimization

## 8. Conclusion

The General Theory of Interaction provides a unified framework for understanding how systems interact across domains. By operationalizing key concepts—recursion, symbolic residue, coherence, and interaction fields—GTI bridges theoretical abstraction and practical application. Our experimental results demonstrate that GTI-based approaches improve performance in computational, cognitive, and social systems.

As artificial intelligence becomes increasingly integrated with human systems, the need for a common framework of interaction grows more urgent. GTI offers such a framework, enabling diverse systems to interact with greater effectiveness, clarity, and coherence. By recognizing the universal patterns of recursive interaction, we can design systems that communicate across boundaries while maintaining the distinct identity that makes meaningful interaction possible.
